# The Law of Total Probability in Lean

## Deconstructing a Compositional Proof with `bind` and `pure`

We now move beyond proofs that are solved by a single `simp` command
and into a more structured proof that requires several foundational tactics.

We will prove a fundamental property about the ciphertext distribution `Î¼C`, which we
define using `bind` and `pure`.

This give us the perfect opportunity to explore tactics like `rw`, `intro`, and
`apply`, and examine their corresponding proof term constructions.

---

### Construction of `Î¼C`

The ciphertext distribution `Î¼C` can be constructed by
chaining two probabilistic processes:

1.  Sample a message-key pair `(m , k)` from their joint distribution `Î¼MK`.

2.  Deterministically compute the ciphertext `c = encrypt m k`.

We capture this nicely in Lean as follows:

```lean
Î¼C = bind Î¼MK (Î» mk => pure (encrypt mk.1 mk.2))
```

To help us understand the meaning of this definition, let's use it to prove a theorem
that computes the probability of a specific ciphertext `c`.

---

### The Law of Total Probability

`P(C=c)` is the sum of probabilities of all `(m, k)` pairs that produce `c`.

!!! info "**Theorem**"

    ```lean
    Î¼C c = âˆ‘' (âŸ¨m , kâŸ© : Plaintext n Ã— Key n), if encrypt m k = c then Î¼MK âŸ¨m , kâŸ© else 0
    ```

Proving this will require unpacking the meaning of `bind` and `pure`.

---

### Setup for the Proof

First we add the necessary definitions to our Lean file.

We need `Plaintext`s, an encryption function, and the distributions `Î¼MK` and `Î¼C`.

For simplicity, we use a simple xor for encryption and assume a uniform distribution
for messages.

```lean
-- Assume a uniform distribution on messages for this example.
noncomputable def Î¼M {n : â„•} : PMF (Plaintext n) :=
  PMF.uniformOfFintype (Plaintext n)

-- Manual construction of the product distribution P(m, k) = P(m) * P(k).
-- (assumes independence of message and key)
noncomputable def Î¼MK {n : â„•} : PMF (Plaintext n Ã— Key n) :=
  PMF.bind Î¼M (Î» m => PMF.map (Î» k => (m, k)) Î¼K)

-- The ciphertext distribution, built with bind and pure.
noncomputable def Î¼C {n : â„•} : PMF (Ciphertext n) :=
  PMF.bind Î¼MK (Î» âŸ¨m, kâŸ© => PMF.pure (encrypt m k))
```

The **law of total probability** says that `P(C=c)` is the sum of probabilities of
all `(m, k)` pairs that produce `c`.

!!! info "**Theorem**"

    ```lean
    Î¼C c = âˆ‘' (mk : Plaintext n Ã— Key n), if encrypt mk.1 mk.2 = c then Î¼MK mk else 0
    ```

---

### The Proof Step-by-Step

Here is the complete, corrected proof in Lean:
```lean
open Classical
theorem Î¼C_apply_eq_sum {n : â„•} (c : Ciphertext n) :

  Î¼C c = âˆ‘' mk : Plaintext n Ã— Key n,
           if encrypt mk.1 mk.2 = c then Î¼MK mk else 0

  := by
  rw [Î¼C, PMF.bind_apply]
  simp only [PMF.pure_apply, mul_boole]
  congr 1
  ext mk
  simp only [eq_comm]
```

#### Step 1: Unfold `bind`

**Tactics**. `rw [Î¼C, PMF.bind_apply]`

+  `rw [Î¼C]`: as before, this is a substitution.

    It replaces `Î¼C` with its definition, `PMF.bind Î¼MK ...`.

    The proof term equivalent is `Eq.subst`.

+  `rw [PMF.bind_apply]`: this is the core of Step 1.

    `PMF.bind_apply` is a theorem in Mathlib that states:

    ```lean
    (PMF.bind p f) y = âˆ‘' x, p x * (f x) y
    ```

    This is a formal expression of the *law of total probability*.

    `rw` finds this lemma and mechanically rewrites the lhs of our goal to match it.

#### Step 1: Unfold `pure`


ðŸ¥… **Goal State** ðŸ¥…

```lean
n : â„•
c : Ciphertext n
âŠ¢ âˆ‘' (a : Plaintext n Ã— Key n),
    Î¼MK a * (match a with | (m, k) => PMF.pure (encrypt m k)) c
= âˆ‘' (mk : Plaintext n Ã— Key n), if encrypt mk.1 mk.2 = c then Î¼MK mk else 0
```

**Tactics**. `simp only [PMF.pure_apply, mul_boole]`

+  `PMF.pure_apply` says `(pure a) b` is 1 if `a = b` and 0 otherwise.

   `simp` is smart enough to apply this inside the summation.

+  `mul_boole` simplifies multiplication with the indicator function.

   It turns the `if` into a multiplication by `1` or `0`.

ðŸ¥… **Goal State After the Tactics** ðŸ¥…

```lean
âŠ¢ (âˆ‘' mk, if c = encrypt mk.1 mk.2 then Î¼MK mk else 0)
= (âˆ‘' mk, if encrypt mk.1 mk.2 = c then Î¼MK mk else 0)
```

Now the only difference between the two sides is the order of the equality:

`c = ...` versus `... = c`.

---

#### Step 2: Aligning the Summations

We need to show the bodies of the two summations are equal.

**Tactics**. `congr 1; ext mk`

* `congr 1`. This "congruence" tactic focuses the proof on the first arguments of the
  equalityâ€”in this case, the functions inside the summations `âˆ‘'`.

* `ext mk`. This "extensionality" tactic then states we can prove the two functions
  are equal by proving they are equal for an arbitrary input, which it names `mk`.

ðŸ¥… **Goal State After the Tactic** ðŸ¥…

```lean
mk: Plaintext n Ã— Key n
âŠ¢   (if c = encrypt mk.1 mk.2 then Î¼MK mk else 0)
  = (if encrypt mk.1 mk.2 = c then Î¼MK mk else 0)
```

---

#### Step 3: Finishing with `eq_comm`

Now we just resolve the switched equality.

**Tactic**. `simp only [eq_comm]`

* The lemma `eq_comm` states that `a = b` is equivalent to `b = a`. `simp` uses this
  to rewrite the goal, making the two sides identical and closing the proof.
