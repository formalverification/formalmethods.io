## Formal Cryptography in Lean

+  [One-time Pad in Lean][]  collects notes on using the Lean proof assistant to formally
   state and prove some basic theorems in cryptography.

+  [lean4crypto][] is a repository, available at <https://github.com/formalverification/lean4crypto>,
   containing Lean programs for formalizing basic cryptography, as described in the notes collected in the *One-time Pad in Lean* section.

+  [lean4crypto documentation][] is available at <https://formalverification.github.io/lean4crypto/OTP/Basic.html>.
